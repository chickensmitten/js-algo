## Run test
- `npx jest` to run test for all the folders
- `npx jest fib/test.js --watch` to have the test `fib` folder running in the background
- debugging
  - put `debugger;` in code 
  - then run `node inspect <filename>.js`
  - press `c` until you hit the code with `debugger;`, then test the code
